# 2D-Game-framework
This project is a library serving as a mini-framework for a turn-based 2D game. It features a world, creatures with attack/defense items, and interactive objects. Designed using SOLID principles and patterns like State, Factory, and Composite, it aims to be flexible and reusable for game development.
